Openbox coding style:

2 space indent, expanded to spaces. No actual tab characters.

Braces do not get a \n before the top one, for example:
	if () {
	}

Put a space between an if/while/etc and the ()'s (see above example)


If you see anythig not laid out, mention it and we can decide what is right and
add it to this file!
