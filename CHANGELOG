   use them if they are available.

 * Add bitmap button support to all the default styles. (Ben Jansens)

 * Change the default premax values to be larger than 0 (Ben Jansens)
   for clients that map in a maximized state. (avoid a
   mozilla crash.)

 * Fix for clients changing from a non-resizable window (Ben Jansens)
   to a resizable window.

 * Fix bug with mutltibyte fonts being really tiny.     (Ben Jansens)

 * Stop using Utf8 drawing routines for Xft. These      (Ben Jansens)
   don't work at all for high-ascii letters, which are
   used in the non-english locales.

 * Fix menu redraw bug when dragging them off-screen or (Scott Moynes,
   under other menus, with Xft fonts.                    Ben Jansens)

 * Build fixes for xftlsfonts and for openbox on        (Marius Nita)
   redhat systems.

2.2.0:
 * Allow changing the appearance of buttons with xbm	(Scott Moynes)
   bitmap files. Can be disabled with 
   --disable-bitmap-buttons.
 
 * Added style textures for				(Scott Moynes)
   window.button.pressed.focus/unfocus:

 * Fixed window menu placement bug			(Scott Moynes)

 * A build fix for xftlsfonts.                          (Scott Moynes)

   options, when Xft is compiled in.

2.1.0:
 * Make alt-right-click resizing work on bottom window  (Ben Jansens)
   handles.

 * Drop shadows for fonts, optional. (dropShadowFonts   (Ben Jansens)
   in the rc file).

 * GNOME 2 Support. (Fixed problems with Gnome 2        (Ben Jansens)
   taskbar.

 * Redo borders for styles. Any flat textured object    (Ben Jansens)
   (solid or gradient) can add "border" to its texture
   and then its ".borderColor" resource will be used
   for a 1 pixel-wide border around the element.

 * Add an optional Sticky button for window titlebars.	(Scott Moynes)
   It can be added by putting an 'S' in your
   titlebarLayout.                                      

 * Fix SendTo menus. They would keep workspaces that
   had been deleted.                                    (Ben Jansens)

 * Fixes for workspace switching. Putting old code      (Ben Jansens)
   back.

 * Fixes for workspace warping. Window and mouse would  (Ben Jansens)
   move slightly out of sync, as one motion event would
   get dropped. Other windows could also be selected
   for moving during the warp. Now everything works as
   expected.

 * Better workspace changing for sticky windows, don't  (Jason Kasper)
   unmap/remap them, causing them to flicker. But keep
   sloppy focus working right still.

 * Fixed Sloppy Focus-Auto Raise bug, as exibited by    (Ben Jansens)
   fullscreen SDL applications. A frame window would
   be raised over the app.

 * Enforce windows' functionality, so that windows that (Ben Jansens)
   aren't suppoosed to be able to perform actions, such
   as iconify, can't end up being iconified anyhow.
   (Fixes the "Desktop Access" feature in KDE.)

 * Fix window gravity handling for an application
   resizing (ConfigureRequest event for resize only).   (Ben Jansens)

 * Fix support for the Shape extension.                 (Ben Jansens)

 * Fix for recognizing kde systray windows unmapping.   (Ben Jansens)

2.0.0:
 * Add an rc option (modiferMask) to allow changing     (Ben Jansens)
   which modifier combo Openbox uses for mouse
   interation with windows.

 * Add an rc option (rootScrollDirection) to specify    (Ben Jansens)
   the direction the workspaces scroll when using the
   mouse wheel on the root window.

 * Add a new checkmark pixmap in the menus to denote    (Ben Jansens)
   selected items, instead of the old colored box.

 * Add "workspace warping" while moving a window. (Grab (Ben Jansens)
   a window and move it past the edge of the screen, so
   that your mouse pointer hits the edge, and you'll
   flip to the next workspace.

 * Add options intheconfig menu for ignoring shaded and (Ben Jansens)
   full-maximized windows when placing new windows.

 * Style extension for flatborder texture type.         (Ben Jansens)

 * Add a window-snapping offset (edgeSnapOffset in the  (Ben Jansens)
   rc file).

 * Window resistance snapping (specified with           (Ben Jansens)
   windowToWindowSnap and windowToEdgeSnap in the rc
   file).

 * Sticky windows appear in the workspace menus         (Ben Jansens)
   for all workspaces, and generally behave like
   a normal window, except appearing on all
   workspaces.

 * Xft font support for styles.                         (Ben Jansens)

 * Xinerama support for window placement, maximization, (Ben Jansens)
   and snapping.

 * NETWM/EWMH Support.                                  (Scott Moynes and
                                                         Ben Jansens)

 * KDE 3 Support.                                       (Scott Moynes and
                                                         Ben Jansens)

 * window zone resizing (specified by resizeZones in    (Ben Jansens)
   the rc file). Allows you to resize a window in 2
   halves or 4 quarters.

 * Allow any style settings to be placed in the rc      (Ben Jansens)
   file, where they will override all styles
   (especially useful for the rootCommand or fonts).

 * Makes the ~/.openbox dir for you if it doesn't       (Ben Jansens)
   exist.

 * Window-to-window snapping (including corner          (Ben Jansens)
   snapping!).

 * Properly save/restore your menu position when        (Ben Jansens)
   Openbox reconfigures (e.g. when changing
   styles).

 * Disable the current workspace in the send-to menu.   (Ben Jansens)

 * Added UnderMouse window placement algorithm/type.    (Ben Jansens)

 * Added ClickMouse window placement algorithm/type.    (Ben Jansens)

 * Added a runtime option for hiding the toolbar.       (Ben Jansens)

 * Custom ordering of windows' titlebar elements with   (Ben Jansens)
   a titlebarLayout option added to the rc file. 

 * Rolling the mouse wheel on a window's title bar will (Ben Jansens)
   shade/unshade the window. rolling the mouse wheel on
   the root window will change workspaces. 

 * Better handling of the rc file and its configuration (Ben Jansens)
   options. The file is written each time an option in
   the file is changed, instead of being written at
   shutdown. This means that you can edit the file by
   hand while in Openbox, and then choose reconfig or
   restart to have it use the new rc file. 

 * Changed the default configuration file from          (Ben Jansens)
   ~/.blackboxrc to ~/.openbox/rc. 

 * Changed the menu from an rcfile option to a          (Ben Jansens)
   command-line option. use 'openbox -menu ' to select
   an alternate menu. The default menu used is
   ~/.openbox/menu. If the default, or the file you
   specify does not exist, the global menu is tried.
   And if the global menu also does not exist, a
   simple, internal menu is used instead.
