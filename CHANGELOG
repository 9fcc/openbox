  * Don't let child (transient) windows steal focus when the situation is
    ambiguous
  * Fix bevels and borders display in the titlebar
  * Set the _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW hint properly, when nothing is focused (This

  * Fixes for default rc.xml configuration file. Updated comments and comment
    out the applications section in an xml compatible way.

    log in.
  * The &lt;desktop&gt; section from the configuration file is only used for
    defaults, and so is only applied at the start of a new log-in. (Use ObConf
    1.6.2 to change the config file for these options, and have them set
    immediately, if you don't use a session manager to save them.)

    will not be pre-built with the wrong info
  * Fix pkg-config files for compiling things against Openbox libraries

    with <startupnotify>. It's an option for execute actions.
  * New combined client menu, accessed with
    <action name="ShowMenu"><menu>client-list-combined-menu</menu></action>

    openbox-session command
  * Many code paths made significantly faster
  * Sections of code rewritten to be more reliable, such as session
    save/restore and input focus handling
  * Handle the X server's clock going backwards, without locking up. Sometimes
    the server can still lock up though, it is not recommended to do this!
  * Better handling of window types such as docks, utility windows, tool bar
    windows. Clicking to focus these windows is done more intelligently.  Dock
    windows no longer get focus when you click them, so that you don't have
    focus flickering when you use a dock window with a taskbar.
  * Better language support through Pango, which is now mandatory, and the
    code for Pango has been greatly improved and optimized.
  * Support for windows that use true 32-bit transparency

    - won't steal focus from other screens, and let you focus a screen by
    clicking on the desktop (root window).
  * Support for more cursors through XCursor, means that startup notification
    can use a pointer+watch cursor if you are using an XCursor theme
  * Fully maximize terminal windows (and any resized-by-increment window)
  * Show the hostname of clients running on remote computers in the titlebar
  * Add <panels> and <desktop> options to NextWindow, PreviousWindow,
    DirectionalFocusNorth etc..
  * Synchronize resizing with the application when possible
  * Smarter subdivision of windows into 9 sections for resizing
  * Set default icon on windows so applications can agree on an icon
  * Better support for programs that are on more than one desktop
    (multiple firefox windows for example) - move to the desktop when you're
    using the application and it opens a window on another desktop.
  * Chrooted key chains, and key quoting through chroots
  * New BreakChroot action to break out of the current chroot
  * New keychains popup, to show where you are in a keychain

  * Support for legacy fullscreen applications (that don't use EWMH) such as
    VLC
  * Session support for old clients that do not use the session management
    protocol
  * Desktop setup is only changed on startup, so as to not overwrite settings
    from other apps like pagers
  * Take advantage of ksmserver (KDE Session Manager) features
  * KDE/Openbox and GNOME/Openbox options for display manager GDM/KDM. Use
    openbox-gnome-session and openbox-kde-session to run a GNOME or KDE
    session with Openbox as the window manager.
  * Titlebar buttons autohide when hiding won't move other buttons (removed
    the hideDisabled option from config file)
  * Support user time window hint, which is good for laptops power usage
  * When legacy windows raise themselves, interpreate as wanting to be
    activated. Makes Firefox more pleasant.
  * Don't show handles on windows that cant resize for more extreme visual
    minimalism
  * Let you move maximized windows between Xinerama monitors
  * Improve application awareness of focus, e.g. Kopete and Firefox, so they
    know when they are or aren't focused, and which window in their
    application is focused
  * Improvements in the distributed themes
  * Add new Clearlooks and Clearlooks-Olive themes by John McKnight
  * Fonts are no longer loaded from theme. They are loaded from the rc.xml
    config file. Font shadow settings are still loaded from the theme though.

    OnScreenDisplay

    properties when you didnt mean to)
  * window.inactive.border.color   (note that globbing might set these
    properties when you didnt mean to)

    (button masks) will be centered
  * Default titlebar button icons (as xbms) installed to /usr/share/doc/openbox
  * New mouse binding contexts Left, Right, TLCorner, TRCorner and Top. These
    need bindings in config file to be useful. Also new context Bottom which
    is synonym for Handle.
  * W is no longer hard coded to Mod4. It is now a shortcut for Super, which
    is usually bound to Mod4. xmodmap will show your mapping.
  * The per-app setting <head> has been renamed to <monitor>
  * Can use "default" for anything in per-app settings

  * Fix panels getting a border with keepBorder turned on.
  * Fix a crash in mirrorhorizontal when drawing a surface with width 1.

3.3:
  * Add a showDelay option for the dock.
  * Fixed onscreen-keeping code which broke a bit in -rc2.
  * Fix incorrect handling of window properties on 64 bit arches.
  * Fix pixelsize being the same as size for pango, now it is correct.
  * Fix drawing of icons taller than wide, eg gimp.
  * Add a 'mirrorhorizontal' gradient, like horizontal but mirrored in the
    center and 'splitvertical' which is like vertical but nonlinear in a fancy
    way.
  * Translations for de, hr and zh_TW added.
  * Add initial per-app settings support.
  * Fix some outstanding issues with 64-bit support.
  * Add an optional delay for displaying submenus so you can move the mouse
    over some entries without flashing each submenu.
  * Plug some minor memleaks and fix minor bugs.
  * Changed algorithm for downscaling window icons.
  * New themes!
  * Disable support for libstartup-notification by default, it doesn't seem
    to work well.
  * Allow disabling of duplicate window numbering by option titleNumber in
    theme section.
  * Add moverelative and resizerelative actions.
  * Option middle for menus that make submenus be centered instead of aligned
    by the top edge to the parent entry.
  * Fix transient (ie dialog) windows being placed offscreen if the parent
    is close to the edge of the screen.

3.3-rc2:
  * Fixed some typos and errors in rc.xsd
  * Add the noStrut option to the dock (to allow maximizing windows over it),
    useful when it is not in the above layer.
  * Fix transparent terminals not updating when using ToggleDecor.
  * Yet more poking at the onscreen-keeping code, should now do the right
    thing always.
  * Add an option to hide disabled buttons instead of showing them as disabled.
  * Hopefully fixed all the remaining pango issues. The new 1.10 release also
    fixes shadows again.
  * I think the lib linking in Makefile.am is right now, please tell me if it
    isn't.
  * Added a finnish translation and some minor updates to others.
  * Fixed configure.ac so --enable-pango doesn't disable pango support or the
    other way around, make enabled be default to get some extra testing.

3.3-rc1:
  * Poked around a bit in the code that keeps windows onscreen, if you
    are using xinerama, please let me know if things are better/worse/same.
  * Add support for pango, disabled by default due to a bug in pango 1.8 that
    breaks shadows, it works fine with 1.6.x though. Poke the pango developers
    here http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169622 if you want this
    to be fixed.
  * Made edge resist and Send/MoveToEdge not hit windows at layers below
    the current one, add option to disable this behaviour.
  * Fixed directional focus not getting trapped in omnipresent windows
  * Fixed focus actions when bound to the mouse, normal focus cycle is always
    linear and directional focus is totally disabled, it makes no sense
    anyway, just move the mouse.

    options called group that lets you bind stuff to raise/lower the whole
    window group. <action name="raise"><group>yes</group></action>
  * Add various new actions. I haven't updated the web docs yet, but I think
    I managed to get all of them listed in rc.xsd.
  * Bugs 1783, 1812, 1863, 1905, 2005, 1957 fixed.
  * Some translations added. (ca, no, pl, ru, fr)

3.2:
  * Added spanish and swedish translations
  * Changed "Unnamed Desktop" to "Desktop n" where n is the actual
    number of the desktop
  * Hopefully no more of the hanging X totally bug
  * the fullscreen property now overrides aspect hints, all programs i've
    tried that use it (mplayer and tvtime) handle the aspect internally
    anyway, this just makes sure you have black borders all the way to the
    edge. If this breaks anything for you, let me know.
  * Added M as an alias for Mod3 in the same manner that W is an alias for Mod4
  * Added probably too many options and actions
    * ToggleDockAutohide to toggle the autohide option at runtime,
      doesn't save it to the config
    * keepBorder option to set if you want the 1-pixel border when you
      toggleDecorations
    * added popupShow and popupPosition to control where and when the
      move/resize-popup is shown, these go in the resize section of the config
      popupPosition can be Top or Center, popupShow can be Always, Never or
      Nonpixel (this is the default).
    * Added the xorStyle option to change the behaviour of menus along the bottom
      edge, note that the default is true
    * warpPointer option in the menu section to control if the mouse cursor is
      to be warped by openbox when the menu moves to keep on screen to keep the
      cursor in the same place relative to the menu. (I think i got that right)
    * Added back the focusLast option (this controls what happens when you
      change desktops and have followMouse on)
    * Added an option to set which desktop to start on when you start openbox,
      firstdesk, for example you might like to set it to 5 if you have a 3x3
      grid to start in the middle.
  * I think that was everything, have fun
