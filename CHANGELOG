3.2:
  * Added spanish and swedish translations
  * Changed "Unnamed Desktop" to "Desktop n" where n is the actual
    number of the desktop
  * Hopefully no more of the hanging X totally bug
  * the fullscreen property now overrides aspect hints, all programs i've
    tried that use it (mplayer and tvtime) handle the aspect internally
    anyway, this just makes sure you have black borders all the way to the
    edge. If this breaks anything for you, let me know.
  * Added M as an alias for Mod3 in the same manner that W is an alias for Mod4
  * Added probably too many options and actions
    * ToggleDockAutohide to toggle the autohide option at runtime,
      doesn't save it to the config
    * keepBorder option to set if you want the 1-pixel border when you
      toggleDecorations
    * added popupShow and popupPosition to control where and when the
      move/resize-popup is shown, these go in the resize section of the config
      popupPosition can be Top or Center, popupShow can be Always, Never or
      Nonpixel (this is the default).
    * Changed the default behaviour for the menus when opened along the bottom
      edge of the screen, the xorStyle option can be used to turn it on again
    * warpPointer option in the menu section to control if the mouse cursor is
      to be warped by openbox when the menu moves to keep on screen to keep the
      cursor in the same place relative to the menu. (I think i got that right)
    * Added back the focusLast option (this controls what happens when you
      change desktops and have followMouse on)
    * Added an option to set which desktop to start on when you start openbox,
      firstdesk, for example you might like to set it to 5 if you have a 3x3
      grid to start in the middle.
  * I think that was everything, have fun
