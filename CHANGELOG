Changelog for Openbox:

1.0.1:
 * improved logic for decorating windows when the
   decoration level is changed.                         (Ben Jansens)

 * fix positioning of the window menu.                  (Ben Jansens)

 * save the titlebarLayout in the default config file.  (Ben Jansens)

 * gcc 3 compatibilty                                   (Ben Jansens)

1.0.0:
 * maximizing windows takes the slit into account as
   well as the toolbar when 'Full Maximization' is off  (Ben Jansens)

 * better handling of the rc file and its configuration
   options. The file is written each time an option in
   the file is changed, instead of being written at
   shutdown. This means that you can edit the file by
   hand while in Openbox, and then choose reconfig or
   restart to have it use the new rc file.              (Ben Jansens)

 * added a runtime option for hiding the toolbar.       (Scott Moynes)
	
 * made shaded windows edge-snap correctly to the
   bottom for their size instead for their unshaded
   size.                                                (Ben Jansens)

 * added BestFit window placement algorithm/type.       (Ruhi Bloodworth)

0.99.1:
 * forced a redraw of the close button after pressing
   it. Some applications (eg. acroread) ignore the
   close request and you end up with a funky close
   button.                                              (Scott Moynes)

0.99.0:
 * renamed header files from *.hh to *.h.               (Ben Jansens)

 * fix clipping of the date/time in the toolbar with
   proportional fonts.                                  (Sean Perry, Ben Jansens)

 * added a --enable-clobber configuration option to
   allow users to turn off the event clobbering by
   hitting the numlock or scroll lock keys.		(Scott  Moynes)

 * window menu is inconsistant in that other menus
   ignore mouse button 2, but it did not, because of
   the maximize option. Now all options in the window
   menu ignore mouse button 2 to be consistant.         (Scott Moynes)

 * changed the default configuration file from
   ~/.blackboxrc to ~/.openbox/rc.                      (Ben Jansens)

 * ignore fully-maximized windows when smart
   placing windows.                                     (Ben Jansens)
      
 * windows snaps to both sides of the screen's edge,
   i.e. they have double the snapping area, half
   inside and half outside the visible screen.          (Ben Jansens)
      
 * a rootCommand per-screen in the rc file which
   will override the rootCommand in styles for that
   screen.                                              (Ben Jansens)
      
 * rolling the mouse wheel on a window's title bar
   will shade/unshade the window. rolling the mouse
   wheel on the root window will change workspaces      (John Kennis, Ben Jansens)
      
 * new button press/release code in Window class,
   gives window buttons more consistent behavior.       (Ben Jansens)
     
 * custom ordering of windows' titlebar elements
   with a titlebarLayout option added to the
   rc file                                              (MrFab, Ben Jansens)
    
 * when resizing a window in non-opaque mode, fixed
   the drawn rectangle so that it is drawn entirely
   within the bounds of the new window. it used to
   be drawn in the area of the window + 1.              (Ben Jansens)
      
 * changed the background of the toolbar's workspace
   label when it is being edited. The text color
   being used was that of the active window label,
   but the background remained that of the toolbar.
   Changed to use the background of the active
   window label.                                        (Ben Jansens)

 * added windowZones to the rc file specifying
   the number of zones to divide a window into for
   alt-drag resizing, and code to resize windows
   with the number of zones specified.                  (Nicolas Delon, Ben Jansens)
