	* Fix crash when restoring a session with a maximized window
	* Fix leak of RrColors in menus
	* Closed bug #929 (crash (signal 11) when activating Reconfigure)
	* Allow focus to be moved around by clients (for WM_TAKE_FOCUS to
	work as it is meant to). This means fullscreen apps like wine and
	bzflag work now

	switching actions

	(via Alt-MiddleClick-Drag with the default bindings)

	window types
	* Closed bug #902 (Openbox raises gDesklets when clicked). This has the
	side effect that panels which do not set the ABOVE state (most panels

	ABOVE state yourself by using the client menu (Alt-RightClick in the
	default bindings) and selecting the Always on top Layer
	* Closed bug #907 (window focus is not properly indicated)
	* Added a focus indicator during focus cycling that is always visible
	instead of just moving the focus hilight around.

	will still fallback to its parent or transient siblings

	* Removed the focusLast option

	under the mouse pointer
