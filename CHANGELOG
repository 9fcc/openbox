Changelog for Openbox:

1.2.3:
 * properly map iconified windows, especially on
   restart. (bbkeys stays iconified.)                   (Ben Jansens)

 * fix bug where iconic sticky windows would randomly
   not be iconified when they were mapped.              (Ben Jansens)

 * snap windows to the slit as well as toolbar, and to
   the screen edges also. (Only when Full Max is off.)  (Ben Jansens)

 * new options: snap windows to other windows, and
   snap windows to other windows' corners.              (Ben Jansens)

 * fix some off-by-one window placement problems.       (Ruhi Bloodworth)

 * Fix bug where bbtools could end up with an extra
   window when deleting a sticky window.                (Ben Jansens)

 * better allow windows to set sticky on startup.       (Ben Jansens)

 * use a different method to focus the root window as
   the focus fallback.                                  (Ben Jansens)

1.2.2:
 * ignore fully maximized windows while placing new
   windows.                                             (Ben Jansens)

 * change cascade's behavior to be less likely to place
   over a window and to reset when the workspace is
   empty.                                               (Ben Jansens)

 * fixes for bsetroot support of Eterm/Esetroot atoms.  (Ben Jansens)

 * make reconfigure save where you are in the menu
   properly, and restore it as best it can (i.e. it
   used to save only 1 level, now it saves them all).   (Ben Jansens)

 * fix bug when removing a workspace with windows. (stl
   misuse, an iterator became invalidated.)             (Ben Jansens)

 * back out all changes for sticky windows as it is not
   about to work. This will be implemented in the next
   development series instead. Use a slightly improved
   focus model for sticky windows, in the meantime.     (Ben Jansens)

1.2.1:
 * fix compiling with --disable-slit and --disable-nls. (Ben Jansens)

 * better sticky windows behavior. Sticky windows
   appear in the window lists on all workspaces and
   obey focus order rules on each workspace the same as
   non-sticky windows.                                  (Ben Jansens)

 * make reconfigure reset the timeout values for
   windows, the slit, and the toolbar, so that a new
   autoRaiseDelay value will take effect without having
   to restart.                                          (Ben Jansens)

 * fix for loading the autoRaiseDelay value.            (Ben Jansens)

1.2.0:
 * fix off-by-one window resizing bug.                  (Ben Jansens)

 * fix for slit menu not using the correct style when
   the style changed.                                   (Ben Jansens)

 * changed the menu from an rcfile option to a command-
   line option. use 'openbox -menu <file>' to select an
   alternate menu. The default menu used is
   ~/.openbox/menu. If the default, or the file you
   specify does not exist, the global menu is tried.
   And if the global menu also does not exist, a
   simple, internal menu is used instead.               (Ben Jansens)

 * new version of bsetroot ported from blackbox cvs
   with intent to support Eterm/Esetroot.               (Sean Perry)

 * make bsetroot behave properly with Eterm/Esetroot.   (Ben Jansens)

 * new version of bsetbg.                               (Timothy King)

 * fix the 'wrong window move' bug displayed by apps
   such as bbkeys.                                      (Sean Perry)

 * fix bug when removing and then readding a titlebar
   button without restarting (by reconfiguring).        (Ben Jansens)

 * more focus code changes. also fixes a segfault from
   last round of focus changes.                         (Ben Jansens)
 
 * make image dithering value load correctly.           (Ben Jansens)

 * fix segfault with multiple screens.                  (Sean Perry)

1.1.0:
 * improved focused window logic to remove a segfault
   when the focused window on an inactive workspace
   closes, and focusLastWindow is enabled.              (Ben Jansens)

 * bsetroot supports transparent applications by
   setting the xrootpmap_id property on the root
   window                                               (Sean Perry)

 * added ClickMouse window placement algorithm/type.    (Ben Jansens)
 
 * added UnderMouse window placement algorithm/type.    (Ben Jansens)

 * improved logic for decorating windows when the
   decoration level is changed                          (Ben Jansens)

 * fix positioning of the window menu                   (Ben Jansens)

 * save the titlebarLayout in the default config file.  (Ben Jansens)

 * gcc 3 compatibilty                                   (Ben Jansens)

1.0.0:
 * maximizing windows takes the slit into account as
   well as the toolbar when 'Full Maximization' is off  (Ben Jansens)

 * better handling of the rc file and its configuration
   options. The file is written each time an option in
   the file is changed, instead of being written at
   shutdown. This means that you can edit the file by
   hand while in Openbox, and then choose reconfig or
   restart to have it use the new rc file.              (Ben Jansens)

 * added a runtime option for hiding the toolbar.       (Scott Moynes)
	
 * made shaded windows edge-snap correctly to the
   bottom for their size instead for their unshaded
   size.                                                (Ben Jansens)

 * added BestFit window placement algorithm/type.       (Ruhi Bloodworth)

 * forced a redraw of the close button after pressing
   it. Some applications (eg. acroread) ignore the
   close request and you end up with a funky close
   button.                                              (Scott Moynes)

 * fix positioning of the window menu                   (Ben Jansens)

0.99.0:
 * renamed header files from *.hh to *.h.               (Ben Jansens)

 * fix clipping of the date/time in the toolbar with
   proportional fonts.                                  (Sean Perry, Ben Jansens)

 * added a --enable-clobber configuration option to
   allow users to turn off the event clobbering by
   hitting the numlock or scroll lock keys.		(Scott  Moynes)

 * window menu is inconsistant in that other menus
   ignore mouse button 2, but it did not, because of
   the maximize option. Now all options in the window
   menu ignore mouse button 2 to be consistant.         (Scott Moynes)

 * changed the default configuration file from
   ~/.blackboxrc to ~/.openbox/rc.                      (Ben Jansens)

 * ignore fully-maximized windows when smart
   placing windows.                                     (Ben Jansens)
      
 * windows snaps to both sides of the screen's edge,
   i.e. they have double the snapping area, half
   inside and half outside the visible screen.          (Ben Jansens)
      
 * a rootCommand per-screen in the rc file which
   will override the rootCommand in styles for that
   screen.                                              (Ben Jansens)
      
 * rolling the mouse wheel on a window's title bar
   will shade/unshade the window. rolling the mouse
   wheel on the root window will change workspaces      (John Kennis, Ben Jansens)
      
 * new button press/release code in Window class,
   gives window buttons more consistent behavior.       (Ben Jansens)
     
 * custom ordering of windows' titlebar elements
   with a titlebarLayout option added to the
   rc file                                              (MrFab, Ben Jansens)
    
 * when resizing a window in non-opaque mode, fixed
   the drawn rectangle so that it is drawn entirely
   within the bounds of the new window. it used to
   be drawn in the area of the window + 1.              (Ben Jansens)
      
 * changed the background of the toolbar's workspace
   label when it is being edited. The text color
   being used was that of the active window label,
   but the background remained that of the toolbar.
   Changed to use the background of the active
   window label.                                        (Ben Jansens)

 * added windowZones to the rc file specifying
   the number of zones to divide a window into for
   alt-drag resizing, and code to resize windows
   with the number of zones specified.                  (Nicolas Delon, Ben Jansens)
