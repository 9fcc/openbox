The data/ directory holds some menu and style (or theme) examples for Openbox.

The styles are installed as system defaults, and are ALWAYS overwritten when
upgrading or otherwise re-installing Openbox.  Changes to them are
discouraged, because of this reason.

In the data/ directory, you will find a directory named `styles.'  These are
the system defaults that are installed when Openbox is built, and they are
intended as examples on how to customize and control the appearance of Openbox.
In the event that a user does not have a defined style, Openbox falls back on
the example styles included here.

Also in the data/ directory is a file named `menu'.  This is meant as an
example but is also installed if make install detects that no menu exists.
If openbox is ever started without a valid menu the user will get a backup
menu which gives the ability to launch a xterm and exit the window manager.

For information on creating/editing a menu, see the file README.menu.

For information on creating/editing a style, see the file README.style.
