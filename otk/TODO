* Implement borders and border overlapping in widget
        the widget has a outer geometry(that of the border) and a inner one
        (the current geometry)
        if the overlap flag is true, the inner widgets' borders are overlapped
        as much as possible while the widgets are still entirely visible.

* make OtkButton do pixmaps

* OtkMenu
        this can wait, probably

* OtkWidget
        see about focus()
        focus() on widgets means 'highlight', not take Focus. solve this mess

* OtkTextWidget
        widget that holds text that can be justified and whatnot
        the button should prolly be modified to subclass this

* OtkApplication
        do all derty work init display/screen/style/image control etc
        event loop
        do docking
        close app, clean up crap
        watch for style properties on the root window, update crap
                on the fly.

* widget factory for openbox
        singleton that fetches widgets to openbox so that openbox
        doesn't need to do useless work in creating/initializing/etc

* cleanup image code
        less deps on screen and display
        what's this thing about 8bpp being busticatered

* cleanups
        name classes OtkBummy instead of OB... or B...
        make Style hold pointers to colors and textures
