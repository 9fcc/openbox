So I had a bit of a rant and thought I'd save it...


01:15 * xOr figures python wont last for ob4, but we'll see
01:15 (xOr) since theres only so much you can do
01:15 (xOr) and some added config files/c code can do it all
01:16 (xOr) i mean, realisticly, how many people are going to make .py's
01:16 (xOr) theyre going to ask me for a new feature
01:16 (xOr) they wont write a py
01:16 (xOr) so a clean and smart c kernel with sub modules of C code would 
            probly be more optimal eventually
01:17 (xOr) scripting was cool for gnus, but i wished i could just set it (mutt)
01:17 (shrimpx) .so's would be cool in the absence of scripting, prolly
01:17 (xOr) yea thats what im meaning
01:17 (xOr) like engines, but for functions
01:18 (xOr) so youd replace bbappconf witha .so that can interact properly
01:18 (xOr) and you dont have to write all this crazy Python/c at all and you 
            end up with something easier to configure
01:18 (xOr) with less effort
01:20 (@xOr) also less room for pregnancy [strong typing is good] with all C
01:21 (@xOr) and less 'my python script wont load, tteach me python xor'
01:44 (@xOr) what i figure would happen over slow evolution course is..
01:44 (@xOr) python modules would be converted to python/c inline shit
01:44 (shrimpx) xOr: you know that some wacko is going to embed python in an .so
1:45 (@xOr) shrimpx: and itd probly be better
01:45 (@xOr) shrimpx: cuz it would do less stuff
01:45 (shrimpx) less stuff == less defensive programming against moron 
                extension programmers
01:45 (@xOr) yea
01:45 (@xOr) and less to try learn to use it
01:46 (@xOr) and less to screw up
01:56 (@xOr)  and for instance, if we were to look at emacs, which is the 
             probably most popular scripted application
01:56 (@xOr) my .emacs is not crazy code
01:56 (@xOr) its some keybindings
01:56 (@xOr) and setting variables
01:57 (shrimpx) yah but 99% of emacs functionality is in lisp
01:57 (@xOr) ya
01:57 (@xOr) but thats not a reason to use it
01:57 (@xOr) or a reason why its good
01:58 (@xOr) thats just the language of implementation
01:58 (shrimpx) even tho it's not .rc
01:58 (@xOr) its good because entensions are written in the same language as 
             its implementation
01:58 (@xOr) do vim plugins have access to the same amount of internals as 
             emacs entensions?
01:59 (shrimpx) no
01:59 (@xOr) right
01:59 (@xOr) this i think is why emacs is better than vim
01:59 (@xOr) youcan write a crazy dope cvs.el
01:59 (@xOr) you can write shell.el
01:59 (@xOr) you cant do these with vim
01:59 (@xOr) you can make hackish addons with keybindings
02:00 (@xOr) so if openbox has .so plugins, its equally as good for exteding as 
             with python extensions
02:00 (@xOr) possibly better because you can access more
