Openbox TODO list:

* make Escape key cancel moving/resizing a window

* add asserts all throughout the code to catch bugs.

* new configuration class which handles the X db, with better functionality.
  i.e. make changes in the configuraiton save instantly, and stop saving over
  the config file on shutdown/reconfig.

* convert char *'s to stl's std::string.

* make the toolbar a compile-time option so it can be disabled entirely.

* make it possible to cuycle workspaces by moving the mouse past the edge of
  the desktop?

* make the wheel mouse functionality optional?

* add a modifer key which will scroll workspaces with the mousewheel even when
  not on the root window?

* NETWM support (see http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec/).

* handle keyboard input natively instead of relying on an external program?

* remappable bindings for keyboard input and for mouse input.

* snap to edges, all edges, including window edges

* port bbconf to Openbox.

* add a close button to root/pinned menus?

* add atoms for most everything in the window manager
  e.g. add _BLACKBOX_STYLE and _BLACKBOX_MENU atoms so that bbtools, bbconf,
  etc. can get the current path to the style in use and menu.

* when workspace name is greater than the width of its text area the toolbar
  gets very ugly. I think waht's really needed is a new toolbar entirely, which
  can let apps dock in it (these would, of course then, be very tiny apps).

* get translations of Openbox into more languages.

* window stacking layers (i.e. always on top/bottom).

* draw non-opaque move/resize frames using the style's borderWidth.

* better support for window groups.

* support for Xft, to anti-alias text.

* suppert for XRENDER, and use it for making window decorations/menus/etc
  translucent.

* fix any existant memory leaks, this is on-going forever.
