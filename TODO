Goals for future releases of Openbox (THIS CAN AND WILL CHANGE):
2.0:
* using std::string instead of char *'s. bool instead of Bool. proper consting
  everywhere where appropriate. unsigned ints where appropriate. etc.

* support for NETWM atoms

* separate Font class with support for Xfonts, xfontsets, and xft.

3.0:
* Add XEventHandler class to make event handling better than ever!

* reorganization of class model. Add XWidget class (contains an X drawable).

* key/mouse/action bindings

* break the themeing into a replaceable plugin/script of some form and possibly
  also for the bindings.

4.0:
* have plugins/scripts for most everything as deemed appropriate.

Openbox TODO list:
* get translations for new NLS entries

* make Escape key cancel moving/resizing a window

* add asserts all throughout the code to catch bugs.

* convert char *'s to stl's std::string. ?? this is a memory leak like no other!

* make it possible to cycle workspaces by moving the mouse past the edge of
  the desktop?

* make the wheel mouse functionality optional?

* add a modifer key which will scroll workspaces with the mousewheel even when
  not on the root window?

* NETWM support (see http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec/).

* handle keyboard input natively instead of relying on an external program?

* remappable bindings for keyboard input and for mouse input.

* snap to edges, all edges, including window edges

* port bbconf to Openbox.

* add a close button to root/pinned menus?

* add atoms for most everything in the window manager
  e.g. add _BLACKBOX_STYLE and _BLACKBOX_MENU atoms so that bbtools, bbconf,
  etc. can get the current path to the style in use and menu.

* when workspace name is greater than the width of its text area the toolbar
  gets very ugly. I think what's really needed is a new toolbar entirely, which
  can let apps dock in it (these would, of course then, be very tiny apps).

* get translations of Openbox into more languages.

* window stacking layers (i.e. always on top/bottom).

* draw non-opaque move/resize frames using the style's borderWidth.

* better support for window groups.

* support for Xft, to anti-alias text.

* suppert for XRENDER, and use it for making window decorations/menus/etc
  translucent.

* fix any existant memory leaks, this is on-going forever.
