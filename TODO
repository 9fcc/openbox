Goals for future releases of Openbox (THIS CAN AND WILL CHANGE):
3.0:
* Add XEventHandler class to make event handling better than ever!

* Crazy dope support for dockapps. Fully mimic window maker's handling of them.

* reorganization of class model. Add XWidget class (contains an X drawable).

* key/mouse/action bindings
* handle keyboard input natively instead of relying on an external progra
* remappable bindings for keyboard input and for mouse input.

* break the themeing into a replaceable plugin/script of some form and possibly
  also for the bindings.

* new sex menus (circular n shit)

* window stacking layers (i.e. always on top/bottom).

* add atoms for most everything in the window manager
  e.g. add _BLACKBOX_STYLE and _BLACKBOX_MENU atoms so that bbtools, bbconf,
  etc. can get the current path to the style in use and menu.

* keep track of what strings are Utf8 and what aren't and use the appropriate
  functions!

4.0:
* have plugins/scripts for most everything as deemed appropriate.

Openbox TODO list:
* make moving/resizing cancellable with a binding

* add asserts all throughout the code to catch bugs.

* make it possible to cycle workspaces by moving the mouse past the edge of
  the desktop

* port bbconf to Openbox.

* when workspace name is greater than the width of its text area the toolbar
  gets very ugly. I think what's really needed is a new toolbar entirely, which
  can let apps dock in it (these would, of course then, be very tiny apps).

* draw non-opaque move/resize frames using the style's borderWidth.

* suppert for XRENDER, and use it for making window decorations/menus/etc
  translucent.
