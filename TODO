Goals for future releases of Openbox (THIS CAN AND WILL CHANGE):
3.0:
* Add XEventHandler class to make event handling better than ever!
  - no longer applicable

* Crazy dope support for dockapps. Fully mimic window maker's handling of them.
  - no, nm this. wmaker is poo.

* reorganization of class model. Add XWidget class (contains an X drawable).
  - using C, no longer using Xlib wrapping classes.

* key/mouse/action bindings
  - done.
* handle keyboard input natively instead of relying on an external program
  - done.
* remappable bindings for keyboard input and for mouse input.
  - done.

* break the themeing into a replaceable plugin/script of some form and possibly
  also for the bindings.
  - done.

* new sex menus (circular n shit)

* window stacking layers (i.e. always on top/bottom).
 - done.

* add atoms for most everything in the window manager
  e.g. add _BLACKBOX_STYLE and _BLACKBOX_MENU atoms so that bbtools, bbconf,
  etc. can get the current path to the style in use and menu.
  - style hint is obsoleted by engines.

* keep track of what strings are Utf8 and what aren't and use the appropriate
  functions!
  - done.

4.0:
* have plugins/scripts for most everything as deemed appropriate.

Openbox TODO list:
* make moving/resizing cancellable with a binding

* add asserts all throughout the code to catch bugs.

* make it possible to cycle workspaces by moving the mouse past the edge of
  the desktop

* port bbconf to Openbox.

* draw non-opaque move/resize frames using the style's borderWidth.
