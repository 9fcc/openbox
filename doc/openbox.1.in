.SH NAME
openbox \- a window manager for X11
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR openbox " \-help | \-version"
.br
.B openbox 
.RI "[ \-rc" " rcfile " "] [ \-display" " display " ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"
.\" First few Paragraphs taken from FILLMEINNOW
.\"
.\"Openbox is yet another addition to the list of window managers for the Open
.\"Group's X Window System, Version 11 Release 6 and above.
.\"Openbox is built with C++, sharing no common code with any other window
.\"manager (even though the graphics implementation is similar to that of Window
.\"Maker).
.\".PP
.\"From the time the first line of code was written, Openbox has evolved around
.\"one premise, minimalism.
.\"It's not meant to be Eye Candy, nor the most Featureful, nor the most Adorned
.\"for modelling the Widely acclaimed NeXT interface.
.\"It is just meant to be
.\".BR fast .
.\".PP
.\"Openbox provides configurable window decorations, a root menu to launch
.\"applications, and a toolbar that shows the current workspace name, the focused
.\"application name, and the current time.
.\"There is also a workspace menu to add or remove workspaces. The `slit' can be
.\"used to dock small applications, e.g. most of the bbtools can use the slit.
.\".PP
.\"Openbox features a special kind of icon handling: When you minimize a window,
.\"no icon appears; instead, you can view all minimized applications in the `Icons'
.\"submenu of the workspace menu.
.\"Your desktop will never get cluttered with icons. As an alternative to icons,
.\"shaded windows are provided: A double click on the titlebar of a window will
.\"shade it (i.e. the window will disappear; only the titlebar stays visible).
.\".PP
.\"Openbox uses its own graphics class to render its images on the fly.
.\"By using style files, you can determine at a great level how your desktop looks.
.\"Openbox currently uses the Blackbox protocol to communicate with other clients
.\"such as the pager.  Work is underway to support the new window manager
.\"specification that both GNOME and KDE use.
.SH OPTIONS
Openbox supports the following command line options:
.TP
.B \-help
Display command line options and compiled-in features, then exit.
.TP
.B \-version
Display version info and exit.
.TP
.BI \-rc \ rcfile
Use another rcfile than the default
.IR  "~/.openbox/rc" .
.TP
.BI \-display \ display
Start Openbox on the specified display.
Programs started by Openbox will have the
.B DISPLAY
environment variable set to this value, too.
.SH RUNNING OPENBOX
This program is usually started by the user's startup script, most times called
.IR ~/.xinitrc .
To run openbox, modify the script by adding
.EX 0
exec openbox
.EE
as the last executed command of the script.
When Openbox terminates, the X session will terminate too.
.PP
When started, Openbox will try to find a default menu file in
.IR @defaultmenu@ .
You can provide a system-wide menu for your users here.
.PP
On exit or restart, Openbox will save user defaults in the file
.I ~/.openbox/rc
in the user's home directory.
Some resources in this file can be edited by hand.
.SH USING OPENBOX
Openbox does no keyboard handling by itself; instead, it relies on an external
program
.IR epist (1)
or
.IR bbkeys (1)
for this.
So, in this section, we will discuss all mouse commands.
.SS Root window (background):
A right click (button 3) will pop up the root menu.
With this, you can launch your applications.
You can also customize this menu for your needs.  See above for its location.
A middle click (button 2) will pop up the workspace menu.
You can add or remove a workspace, view
applications running on all workspace, inspect your iconified applications,
and jump directly to any workspace or application.
.PP
Left clicking (button 1) on an application in the Workspaces menu will bring
you to that workspace and raise/focus that application;
middle clicking (button 2) will warp the application to the current workspace.
.SS Toolbar:
The toolbar consists of three fields: a workspace name, the name of the
window that currently has focus, and a clock.
A left click on the toolbar will bring it to the foreground, a
middle click will hide it behind other windows (if AlwaysOnTop is not set), and
the right button will bring up a little menu.
.PP
Using this menu, you can enter a name for the current workspace (when finished,
press Enter).
Also, you can choose the toolbar's position, whether or not it
should be always on top (i.e. it cannot be obscured by other windows),
and whether it should hide itself when the mouse moves away.
.PP
Note: In Openbox versions below 0.60.0, a right click on the toolbar
immediately entered workspace name edit mode.
.SS Window Titlebar and Borders:
A left click on any part of the window's border will raise it.
Dragging then moves the window.
Dragging the resize grips at the bottom left and bottom right
corners resizes the window.
Middle clicking will immediately lower the window.
Right clicking on the border or titlebar pops up the window menu,
containing these commands:
.TP
.B Send To...
Send window to another workspace.
When you select the workspace with the middle button, Openbox will
send you, along with the application, to the selected workspace.
.TP
.B Shade
Shade window (display titlebar only).
.TP
.B Iconify
Iconify window.
The `icon' can be found in the `Icons' submenu of the workspace menu.  It will
*NOT* appear on screen otherwise.
.TP
.B Maximize
(Un)Maximize window.
When you click the middle button on this item, the
window will maximize only vertically.
.TP
.B Raise
Raise window.
.TP
.B Lower
Lower window.
.TP
.B Stick
(Un)Stick window.
A stuck window will always be displayed in the current workspace.
.TP
.B Kill Client
Kill (-SIGKILL) owner of window.  Only use this if the client refuses to close.
.TP
.B Close
Close the application cleanly.
.PP
When you double click on the titlebar of a window, it will `shade', so
that only the titlebar stays visible.
Another double click will redisplay the window contents.
.SS Window Buttons:
The button at the left upper corner of a window is the Minimize button.
Clicking with any button causes the window to be iconified.
The rightmost button (with the X) closes the application.
The other button on the right (if present) maximizes the window in three ways:
Button 1 causes full screen maximization, button 2 maximizes the window only
vertically, and button 3 only horizontally.
.SS Any menu:
Clicking button 3 in a menu will popdown the menu.
Clicking button 1 on the titlebar of any (sub)menu and then dragging it somewhere
else will cause the menu to stay visible, and not disappear when you click on
a menu item.
.SS Miscellaneous:
When you want to drag a window, but cannot see either the bottom handle or its
titlebar, you can press Alt + button 1 anywhere in the window and then
drag it around.
You can also use Alt + button 1 to raise a partially visible window.
Finally, Alt + button 2 lowers a window, and Alt + button 3 resizes the window.
.SH MENU FILE
A default menu file is installed in
.IR @defaultmenu@ .
Of course, this system-wide menu can be customized for all users at once.
But it is also possible to create a personal menu.
Openbox looks for a menu in your home directory under the location
.IR "~/.openbox/menu" .
You can copy the system-wide menu file to this location or create it by hand.
The next time you start/restart Openbox, it will use your custom menu file
instead of the system-wide one.
Be sure that your menu is usable, then choose `Restart' from the default
Openbox root menu to see your new menu in action.
.SS Menu syntax
The menu syntax is very simple and very effective.
There are up to three fields in a menu line.
They are of the form:
.EX
[tag] (label or filename) {command or filename}
.EE
The supported tags are as follows:
.TP
.B [begin] (label for root menu)
This tells Openbox to start parsing the menu file.
This tag is required for Openbox to parse your menu file.
If it cannot find it, the system default menu is used instead.
.TP
.B [end]
This tells Openbox that it is at the end of a menu.
This can either be a submenu or the main root menu.
There must be at least one of these tags in your menu to correspond to the
required [begin] tag.
.TP
.B [exec] (label for command) {shell command}
Inserts a command item into the menu.
When you select the menu item from the menu, Openbox runs `shell command.'
.TP
.B [exit] (label for exit)
Inserts an item that shuts down and exits Openbox.
Any running programs are not closed.
.TP
.B [include] (filename)
Parses the file specified by
.I filename
and includes it with the current menu. The filename can be the full path to a
 file, or it can begin with
.IR ~/ ,
which will be expanded into your home directory (e.g.
.EX
[include] (~/.openbox/stylesmenu)
.EE
will include
.I /home/bhughes/.openbox/stylesmenu
in my menu).
.TP
.B [nop] (label - optional)
Insert a non-operational item into the current menu.
This can be used to help format the menu into blocks or sections
if so desired.
.B [nop]
does accept a label, but it is not required, and a blank item will be used
if none is supplied.
.TP 
.B [style] (label) {filename}
This tells Openbox to insert an item that, when selected, reads the style file
named
.I filename
and applies the new textures, colors, and fonts to the current
running session.
.TP
.B [stylesdir] (directory name)
Reads all filenames (directories are ignored) from the specified directory and
 creates menu items in the current menu for every filename.  Openbox assumes
 that each file is a valid style file.  When selected by the user, Openbox 
applies the selected style file to the current session.
The labels that are created in the menu are the filenames of the style files.
.TP
.B [stylesmenu] (label) {directory name}
Creates a submenu entry with
.I label 
(that is also the title of the new submenu), and inserts in that submenu all
filenames in the specified directory, in the same way as the
.B [stylesdir]
command does.
.IP
.RB Both\  [stylesdir] \ and\  [stylesmenu]
commands make it possible to install style files without editing your menu file.
.TP
.B [submenu] (label) {title for menu - optional}
This tells Openbox to create and parse a new menu.
This menu is inserted as a submenu into the parent menu.
These menus are parsed recursively, so there is no limit to the number of levels
or nested submenus you can have.
The title for the new menu is optional; if none is supplied,
the new menu's title is the same as the item label.
An
.B [end]
tag is required to end the submenu.
.TP
.B [reconfig] (label)
When selected, this item rereads the current style, menu files and rc file,
and applies any changes.
This is useful for creating a new style or theme, as you don't have to
constantly restart Openbox every time you save your style.
However, Openbox automagically rereads the menu whenever it changes.
.TP
.B [restart] (label) {shell command - optional}
This tells Openbox to restart.
If `shell command' is supplied, it shuts down and runs the command (which is
commonly the name of another window manager).
If the command is omitted, Openbox restarts itself.
.TP
.B [config] (label)
Inserts a Openbox generated submenu item containing numerous configuration
options concerning window placement, focus style, window moving style, etc.
.TP
.B [workspaces] (label)
This tells Openbox to insert a link to the workspaces menu directly
into your menu.
This is handy for those users who can't access the
workspace menu directly (e.g. if you don't have a 3 button mouse).
.PP
Any line that starts with a `#' is considered a comment and ignored by Openbox.
Also, in the labels/commands/filenames fields,
you can escape any character like so:
.EX
[exec] (\\(my cool\\) \\{XTERM\\}) {xterm -T \\"cool XTERM\\"}
.EE
Using `\\\\' inserts a literal back-slash into the label/command/filename field.
.SS Menu example
Now let's put together some things.
Here is a short example of a menu file:
.PP
.nf
# Openbox menu file
[begin] (Openbox @version@)
  [exec] (rxvt) {rxvt -ls}
  [exec] (Mozilla) {mozilla}
  [exec] (The GIMP) {gimp}
  [submenu] (Window Manager)
    [exec] (Edit Menus) {nedit .openbox/Menu}
    [submenu] (Style) {Which Style?}
      [stylesdir] (~/.openbox/styles)
      [stylesmenu] (Openbox Styles) {@pkgdatadir@/styles}
    [end]
    [config] (Config Options)
    [reconfig] (Reconfigure)
    [restart] (Restart)
  [end]
  [exit] (Log Out)
[end]
# end of menu file
.fi
.SH STYLES
Openbox enables you to use specialized files that contain
.IR X (1)
resources to specify colors, textures, and fonts and therefore
the overall look of your window borders, menus, and the toolbar.
.PP
The default installation of Openbox provides some of these style files.
Usually they are put in
.IR @pkgdatadir@/styles .
You can study or edit these files to grasp how the Openbox style mechanism
works.
You can use the
.BR [style] ", " [stylesdir] " and " [stylesmenu]
menu commands in your menu file to be able to select and change between styles
on the fly.
.PP
You can also create a directory in your home directory (usually named
.I ~/.openbox/styles)
and put your own style files there.
Of course, you may choose any name for this directory, but many downloadable
themes will rely on the name
.I styles
(following the bb.themes.org naming scheme).
.PP
To understand how the style mechanism works, you should have a little knowledge
of how X resources work.
.PP
X resources consist of a key and a value.
The key is constructed of several smaller keys (sometimes referred to as
children), delimited by a period (`.').
Keys may also contain a star (`*') to serve as a wildcard, which means that one
line of typed text will match several keys.
This is useful for styles that are based on one or two colors.
.PP
Openbox allows you to configure its four main components: the toolbar, the
slit, the menus, and the window decorations.
.PP
The little window that shows the x-y position while dragging windows borrows
its style from the window's titlebar.
.PP
Here are some quick examples:
.EX
toolbar.clock.color:	green
.EE
This sets the color resource of the toolbar clock to `green'. Another example:
.EX
menu*color:	rgb:3/4/5
.EE
This sets the color resource of the menu
.I and all of its `children'
to `rgb:3/4/5'.
(For a description of color names, see
.IR X (1).)
So this one also applies to
.IR menu.title.color " and " menu.frame.color .
And with
.EX
*font:	-b&h-lucida-medium-r-normal-*-*-140-*
.EE
you set the font resource for all keys to this font name all at once.
(For information about the fonts installed on your system, you can use a program like
.IR xfontsel "(1), " gtkfontsel ", or " xlsfonts "(1).)"
.PP
Now what makes Openbox just so spectacular is its ability to render textures
on the fly.
Texture descriptions are specified in a similar way to the colors shown above
e.g.:
.ta \w'toolbar.clock.colorTo:\ 'u
.EX
toolbar.clock:	Raised Gradient Diagonal Bevel1
toolbar.clock.color:	rgb:8/6/4
toolbar.clock.colorTo:	rgb:4/3/2
.EE
Don't worry; we will explain right now!
A texture description consists of up to five fields, which are as follows:
.TP
.B Flat / Raised / Sunken
gives the component either a flat, raised, or sunken appearance.
.TP
.B Gradient / Solid
tells Openbox to draw either a solid color or a texture with gradient.
.TP
.B Horizontal / Vertical / Diagonal / Crossdiagonal / Pipecross / Elliptic / Rectangle / Pyramid
Select one of these texture types. They only work when
.B Gradient
is also specified!
.TP
.B Interlaced
tells Openbox to interlace the texture (darken every other line).
This option is most commonly used with gradiented textures, but, from Openbox
version 0.60.3 on, it also works in solid textures.
.TP
.B Bevel1 / Bevel2
tells Openbox which type of bevel to use.
Bevel1 is the default bevel.
The shading is placed on the edge of the image.
Bevel2 is an alternative.
The shading is placed one pixel in from the edge of the image.
.PP
Instead of a texture description, the option
.B ParentRelative
is also available, which makes the component appear as a part of its parent, i.e.
totally transparent.
.PP
All gradient textures are composed of two color values: the
.IR color " and " colorTo " resources."
color represents the initial color, colorTo represents the final color of the
gradient.
When
.B Interlaced 
is used in
.B Solid
mode, the
.I colorTo
resource is used to specify the interlacing color.
.PP
Well, here is the complete component list; also, all components together with
which kind of value they can contain.
Comments are preceded with an exclamation sign (!), which is also used for
comments in Openbox style c.q. X resource files.
.PP

.fi
.PP
Now, this seems a long list, but, remember, when you create your own style, you
can easily set lots of keys with a single command, e.g.
.EX
.ta \w'*unfocus.textColor:\ 'u
*color:	slategrey
*colorTo:	darkslategrey
*unfocus.color:	darkslategrey
*unfocus.colorTo:	black
*textColor:	white
*unfocus.textColor:	lightgrey
*font:	lucidasans-10
.EE
This sets already nice defaults for many components.
.PP
Openbox also lets you pick what the small graphics in the buttons and in the manu look like. It uses the X Bitmap file format (.xbm extension). The style resources are as follows:
.EX
! Close, maximize, sticky and iconify
! buttons on a window.
window.button.close.mask:       xbm file
window.button.max.mask:         xbm file
window.button.stick.mask:       xbm file
window.button.icon.mask:        xbm file

! The icon for submenus in a menu.
menu.arrow.mask:                xbm file

! The icon for a selected option or workspace
! in the menus.
menu.selected.mask:             xbm file

! The left and right buttons in the toolbar
toolbar.button.left.mask:       xbm file
toolbar.button.right.mask:      xbm file
.EE
If the xbm file value is the path to a .xbm image. If the value is absolute, it uses that file. If the file is just a file name, e.g. `close.xbm', it uses ~/.openbox/buttons/close.xbm.
.SH THE SLIT
The slit is a special Openbox window frame that can contain dockable
applications, e.g. the `bbtools' or WindowMaker's dockapps.
When applications are run in the slit, they have no window borders of their own;
instead, they are framed in the slit, and they are always visible in the current
workspace.
You can click button 3 on the edge of the slit window to get a menu to
determine its position, whether its contained applications should be grouped
horizontally or vertically and whether it should hide itself when the
mouse moves away.
.PP
Most dockable applications use the
.B -w
option to run in the slit.
For example, you could put in your
.IR ~/.xinitrc :
.EX
bbmail -w &
bbpager -w &
exec openbox
.EE
Of course, to use the slit, you must have slit support compiled in (this is
the default).
.SH RESOURCE FILE
Usually the
.I ~/.openbox/rc
resource file is created and maintained by Openbox itself.
All options from the
.B [config]
menu (from 0.60.x on), the last selected style file, your workspace names and
so on are saved automatically in this file.
.PP
For a complete description of all of the resource file's options, see the
documentation at
.B http://icculus.org/openbox/rc.php
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B HOME
Openbox uses
.RB $ HOME
to find its
.I .openbox/rc
and
.I .openbox/menu
files, and to resolve style file and directory names.
.TP
.B DISPLAY
When no other display was given on the command line, Openbox will start on the
display specified by this variable.
