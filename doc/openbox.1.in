.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
Openbox is a next generation, highly 
configurable window manager. Openbox is compliant with the 
latest window manager standards. 
.PP 
You can start Openbox in three ways: 
.PP 
If you run a display manager such as GDM, you will find 3 entries 
in the login session type menu for Openbox: 
\fBGNOME/Openbox\fR, \fBKDE/Openbox\fR       and \fBOpenbox\fR. If you want to use Openbox 
within GNOME or KDE, you can choose the appropriate entry, and it will 
launch GNOME or KDE with Openbox as the window manager. 
.PP 
If you don't want to run Openbox withing a desktop environment, then 
it is recommended that you instead set up a ~/.xsession file and 
use the \fBDefault\fR session type. The ~/.xsession file 
should any applications you want to run at startup, and then run 
\fBopenbox\fR at the end, such as: 
.PP 
.RS 
.PP 
.nf 
xsetroot \-solid grey & 
gnome-settings-daemon & 
exec \fBopenbox\fR 
.fi 
.RE 
.PP 
Lastly, if you use \fBstartx\fR to launch your X 
session, you should set up a ~/.xinitrc file, exactly the same as the 
above ~/.xsession file. 
.PP 
You can use the \fBobconf\fR tool to configure Openbox 
easily with a graphical interface, however more in-depth configuration 
is possible by editing the configuration files by hand. The default 
configuration file is installed in @configdir@/openbox/rc.xml, and the 
user configuration is placed in ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml. You can copy 
the default configuration to ~/.config/openbox and edit it to your 
liking.
