Methods

----

shutdown()

Causes Openbox to shutdown and exit.


----

restart([path])

state()

Returns Openbox's current state, this will be one of the State constants.

	Returns: One of the State values representing the internal state
		 of Openbox.

desktop()

Returns the number of the currently visible desktop. This will be in the range
of [0, numDesktops()).

	Returns: The currently visible desktop.

----

setDesktop(desktop)

Sets the specified desktop as the visible desktop.

	desktop: The desktop to make visible. Must be in the range of
		 [0, numDesktops()) or a ValueError exception will be raised.

----

setNextDesktop([wrap])

Sets the visible desktop to the next desktop, optionally wrapping around when
reaching the last.

	wrap: An optional argument which, when True will cause the function to
	      wrap to the first desktop when going past the last. If it is not
	      specified, it defaults to true.

----

setPreviousDesktop([wrap])

Sets the visible desktop to the previous desktop, optionally wrapping around
when reaching the first.

	wrap: An optional argument which, when True will cause the function to

numDesktops()

Returns the number of desktops available.

	Returns: The number of available desktops.

----

setNumDesktops(num)

Sets the number of desktops available.

	num: The new number of available desktops. This must be greater than 0.

----

desktopNames()

Returns a tuple of names, containing a name for each desktop. The tuple may
have a length greater than numDesktops() if more names have been specified.

----

setDesktopNames(names)

Sets the names for the desktops.

	names: An iterable list of names to apply to the desktops. Can contain
