PointerData

----

This document describes the 'PointerData' class, passed to functions bound to
pointer events.

----

Attributes

----

action

The type of event. One of the input.Pointer.Action_* constants.

----

button

The button (in the format that input.Pointer.bind() expects them) that caused
the event. This will be 'None' if there was no button associated with the
event. (This can only happen during a pointer grab.)

----

context

A string containing the context of the event. See the Terminology section in
the Pointer documentation for a decription and list of common contexts.

----

state

An integer bitmask of the modifiers pressed down when the event occured.

----

buttonnum

An integer containing the number of the pointer button associated with the
event.

----

pos

A tuple containing the current position of the cursor. The tuple has the format
(x, y). This is only valid when 'action' is 'Action_Motion'.

-----

presspos

A tuple containing the position of the cursor when the drag started. The tuple
has the format (x, y). This is only valid when 'action' is 'Action_Motion'.

----

pressclientarea

A tuple containing the area of the client when the drag started. The tuple has
the format (x, y, width, height). This will be None if there is no client
associated with the event (during a pointer grab, or a drag on the root
window). This is only valid when 'action' is 'Action_Motion'.
