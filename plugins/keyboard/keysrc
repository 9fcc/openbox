# Keysrc - Keybindings configuration for Openbox

# Key [Key...] Action [Argument]

# Key: A list of keys to form a key chain, or just a single key.
# Each Key a string composed of [<modifier>-]<key>. A Key can have 0 or more
# modifiers. Valid modifiers are Mod1 ('A' is an alias for this), Mod2, Mod3,
# Mod4 ('W' is an alias for this), and Mod5. Valid buttons are defined by the
# X server. The 'xev' utility can be used to look up the name of a key.
#
# When there is more than one Key in a binding, they form a chain, where you
# must press the first Key, then the second, etc, to fire the binding.
#
# The 'C-g' key combination can be used to abort a key chain in progress.

# Action: The action to be performed when the key binding is pressed.
