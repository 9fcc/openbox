Epist design notes, by woodblock
--------------------------------

- Chained keybindings like emacs, and I suppose vi if you're wierd like that.
 - most actions can take extra parameters. probably only numbers, or strings, maybe both.
 - no interactive string inputs
- A config file that doesn't suck


- exec
- iconify
- raise
- lower
- close
- move to desktop
- send to desktop
- shade
- sticky
- move window (?)
- next/prev window (special orders like stacking, grouping, etc?)
- maximize/minimize
- no stupid window
- toggle keybindings
- menus?

class Action {
 enum type;
 char *string;
 int param;
 Action next;
}
