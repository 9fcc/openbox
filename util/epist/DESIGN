Epist design notes, by woodblock
--------------------------------

- Chained keybindings like emacs, and I suppose vi if you're wierd like that.
- most actions can take extra parameters. probably only numbers,
  or strings, maybe both.
- no interactive string inputs
- A config file that doesn't suck


- exec
- iconify
- raise
- lower
- close
- move to desktop
- send to desktop
- toggle shade
- sticky
- move window
- resize window
- next/prev window (special orders like stacking, grouping, etc?)
- maximize/minimize
- no stupid window
- toggle keybindings
- menus?

class Action {
 enum type;
 char *string;
 int param;
 Action next;
}

option <name> <value>;

action [name] <key> <type> <parameter>;

chain [name] <key> {
	<action name>,
	<action name>,
	...
	}

eg:
 action emacs C-e exec emacs;
 action C-a exec aterm -fn smoothansi;
 action xmms C-x exec xmms;

chain M-q {
	emacs,
	xmms
	}

Would produce M-q C-e -> emacs, M-q C-x -> xmms, C-a -> aterm.
